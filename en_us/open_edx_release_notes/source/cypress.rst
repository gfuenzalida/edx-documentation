Feedback and Hints in Common Problems
======================================

You can now add feedback, hints, or both to the following problem types.

* Checkbox
* Dropdown
* Multiple choice
* Numerical input
* Text input

In Studio, you can use new templates to add sample problems that use the
feedback and hint syntax.

For more information, see `Adding Feedback and Hints to a Problem`_ in
*Building and Running an Open edX Course*.

=====================
Poll and Survey Tools
=====================

You can now include two new types of components in your courses.

* Use the Poll tool to pose a question to learners and have them select an
  answer from a set list.

  For more information, see `Poll Tool`_ in *Building and Running an Open edX
  Course*.

* Use the Survey tool to pose multiple questions to learners and have them
  select an answer for each question from a set list.

  For more information, see `Survey Tool`_ in *Building and Running an Open edX
  Course*.

When you include polls and surveys in a course, you can analyze the responses
and also choose whether to let learners see the aggregate answers for the
class.

=====================
Creative Commons
=====================

Course teams can now specify either "All Rights Reserved" or a Creative Commons license for course content as a whole as well as for each individual video in the course. 

For more information, see the following documentation:

* For configuring your Open edX instance, see `Enabling Course and Video
  Licensing`_ in *Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open edX Platform*.

* For licensing course content, see `Licensing a Course`_ in *Building and
  Running an Open edX Course*.

* For licensing information for learners, see `Course and Video Licenses`_ in
  the *Open edX Leanrer's Guide*.

==========================
Randomized Content Blocks
==========================

Course teams can now include a new type of component, a randomized content
block, in their courses. These components randomly draw problems from a
predefined library of components and present them to learners.

You create and maintain libraries of components separately from courses. All of
an organization’s course teams can work collaboratively to develop the problems
that the libraries contain. Each library can then be referenced by randomized
content blocks in any of that organization’s courses. 

For more information, see `Working with Libraries`_ *Building and Running an
Open edX Course*.

=====================
User Profiles
=====================

With the new Open edX User Profile, you can share information about yourself
with your learning community. Your profile can include an image that identifies
you on the Open edX site as well as your location and other biographical
information. Course teams and other learners in your courses can view your
profile.

For more information, see `Exploring the Profile Page`_ in *Building and
Running an Open edX Course* and `Exploring the Profile Page for Learners`_ in
the *Open edX Learner's Guide*.

======================================================
Original Open Response Assessment Problems Depracated
======================================================

When you access a course that contains an open response assessment created
using the original version of this assignment type (ORA 1), Studio now displays
the message, “This course uses features that are no longer supported.”

A newer version of the open response assessments feature (ORA 2) was released
over a year ago, and the ability to add ORA 1 problems was removed from Studio
in May 2014.

For information about adding ORA 2 problems to a course, see `Open Response
Assessments`_.
