Supported Identity Providers
#######################################

In an exchange of authentication and authorization data, an identity provider
securely asserts the identity and access rights of a set of users. Your
implementation of the Open edX platform is the service provider that allows
the users access on the basis of those credentials.

You can enable third party authentication between your Open edX system and
identity providers that use the SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language,
version 2.0) or OAuth2 standards for authentication. For more information, see
:ref:`Integrating with a SAML Identity Provider` or :ref:`Integrating with an
OAuth2 Identity Provider`.

Regardless of the standard that the identity provider you want to integrate
with uses, you begin by :ref:`enabling the third party authentication
feature<Enable the Third Party Authentication Feature>` for your installation.
